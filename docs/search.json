      "description": "Since I was a young, I’ve always been the person to spend extra time on the trailhead staring at the structure of a trees leaf, or watching a bee pollinate a flower, as my family continued to walk, leaving me in the distance. This passion for nature is what has guided me down the path of biological studies. As I studied at Utah Valley University, I began to narrow my passion to understanding ecological systems and how evolutionary processes have led to the formation of such ecosystems. I am now graduating with a Bachelor’s of Biology, and I hope to now move on to getting a PhD degree, so I may continue to study the various processes that make our world so beautiful and worthy of spending a few extra minutes on the trailhead.",
